# AI OS Core

**AI OS Core** is a privacy-first, local-first AI operating layer for Windows that learns from your daily desktop activity to assist you through intelligent agents — powered entirely by on-device LLMs.

> ⚙️ No chat window.  
> 🧠 No cloud dependency.  
> Just intelligence that watches, learns, and helps.

## 🚀 What It Does

- ✅ Installs a **System Observer Agent** to track user behavior: open apps, window titles, time spent, and more.
- ✅ Logs activity in a structured format (locally).
- ✅ Installs a local LLM (via [Ollama](https://ollama.com)) — e.g., Qwen 2.5B — for semantic processing.
- ✅ Runs an intelligent **Journal Agent** that summarizes daily activity into a personal journal using your private LLM.

All data stays local. You control what is tracked and what is generated.

## 🧱 Project Structure

```bash
/observer        → Tracks apps, windows, activity
/journal_agent   → Generates daily summaries using LLM
/llm             → Runs and connects to local LLM (Ollama)
/data            → Stores logs and generated journals
/installer       → Scripts and assets for .exe installer
💡 How It Works
Installer sets up:

Python environment

Observer Agent (background task)

Ollama + Qwen 2.5B

Observer logs user activity (e.g., "Chrome - Gmail | 10:03 AM - 10:17 AM")

Journal Agent runs daily:

Collects logs

Sends to LLM with summarization prompt

Generates .md or .txt daily journal

User gets an intelligent, private timeline of their work.

📦 Installation
Windows-only (for now)

Coming soon:

.exe installer package (with embedded Python + Ollama setup)

Auto-start service for observer and agents

Toggle for clipboard/browser tracking
