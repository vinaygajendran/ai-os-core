Today was pretty light on activity, with most of my time spent just surfing the web (0.2 minutes in Firefox). The brief session with Notepad and uTorrent suggests a momentary need for quick note-taking or file transfer, but nothing substantial. It seems like you might be spending too much time just idling or moving your cursor around without engaging in any particular tasks.

To stay more productive, consider setting specific goals or定时安排一些任务，比如阅读文档或整理笔记。这样可以帮助你更有效地利用时间。
