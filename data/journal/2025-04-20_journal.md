Today, I mostly spent my time on general browsing and minimal document editing. The majority of my activities were split between Brave (13 seconds) and Cursor (another 13 seconds), which likely reflects some quick web searches or checks. A small portion was also dedicated to a brief uTorrent session for file transfers, and just a bit more time was spent on Notepad for some quick notes.

Noticing the pattern, it seems like my work involves frequent but short bursts of activityâ€”likely indicative of switching between tasks quickly rather than deep focus on one thing for long periods. This could be due to the nature of my work or personal habits. To maintain productivity and focus, perhaps setting longer intervals for task switches or prioritizing more focused sessions might help.
