Write clean, readable Python code (PEP8 recommended)

Keep secrets/configs out of version control

Use config/settings.json for any new toggles

Document agent logic and CLI scripts clearly

Respect privacy: Do not include telemetry or external logging

🧪 Testing
Run main.py and verify output in /data/journal/

Check that logs are properly structured

Use test cases or dry runs where applicable

🙏 Code of Conduct
Be respectful. Be helpful. Build with curiosity.
Let’s create something meaningful.

Happy hacking! 🧠✨
